# Chatbot
Certainly, If you have questions or need information about chatbots, feel free to ask. Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. They use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries or prompts. Depending on their complexity, chatbots can be rule-based (following predefined rules) or powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, allowing them to learn and adapt over time.
